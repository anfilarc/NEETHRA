Features
Real-time disaster monitoring using AI and drones.
Autonomous navigation to predefined GPS coordinates.
Integration with Firebase for location data updates.
Disaster area assessment and data collection.
Customizable for different drone models and disaster scenarios.
Requirements
Before using the Neethra project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

A compatible drone with the necessary hardware and communication interfaces.
Python 3.x installed on your development machine.
Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON file.
Access to a Firebase Realtime Database for storing location data.
Installation
Clone the Neethra repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neethra.git
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd neethra
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON file in the project directory.

Usage
Configure Firebase:

Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/.
Set up a Realtime Database for storing location data.
Obtain the Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON file and place it in the project directory as mentioned in the Installation section.
Connect and Configure Drone:

Connect your drone to your computer using the appropriate communication interface (e.g., USB, UART).
Modify the connection settings in the Python script to match your drone's configuration (e.g., port, baud rate).
Define GPS Coordinates:

Predefine the GPS coordinates of locations you want the drone to navigate to in the Firebase Realtime Database. Use the structure mentioned in the Python script as a reference.
Run the Neethra Program:

Execute the Python script to start the Neethra program:

bash
Copy code
python neethra.py
The program will listen for updates in the Firebase Realtime Database. When new location data is added, the drone will be commanded to navigate to those coordinates.
